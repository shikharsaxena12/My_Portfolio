# Security Fixes Applied

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Hardcoded Credentials (CWE-798)
**Files Fixed:**
- `src/components/OwnerLogin.jsx`
- `src/components/AdminLogin.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Moved hardcoded credentials to environment variables
- Created `.env` file with secure credential storage
- Added `.env.example` for reference
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` files

### 2. Code Injection Vulnerabilities (CWE-94)
**Files Fixed:**
- `src/components/About.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Removed unnecessary `Number.isInteger` validation that could be exploited
- Simplified card rotation logic to use safe modulo operation

### 3. Package Vulnerabilities
**Files Fixed:**
- `package.json`

**Changes:**
- Added package overrides for vulnerable dependencies:
  - `postcss`: Updated to ^8.4.35
  - `serialize-javascript`: Updated to ^6.0.2
  - `webpack-dev-server`: Set to ^4.15.1 (compatible with react-scripts)
- Fixed react-scripts version corruption

## Medium Priority Issues

### 4. Lazy Module Loading
**Files Affected:**
- `webpack.config.js`

**Status:** 
- Reviewed and confirmed as false positive
- Current implementation is safe and follows best practices

### 5. JSX Internationalization
**Files Affected:**
- Multiple component files with hardcoded text

**Status:**
- Low priority issue for portfolio project
- Can be addressed in future if internationalization is needed

## Security Improvements

### 1. Environment Variables
- Created secure credential management system
- Added example file for developers
- Ensured sensitive data is not committed to version control

### 2. Dependency Security
- Updated vulnerable packages through overrides
- Maintained compatibility with existing codebase
- Fixed webpack-dev-server compatibility issues

### 3. Git Security
- Enhanced `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files
- Added comprehensive file exclusion patterns

## Recommendations

1. **Change Default Credentials**: Update the credentials in `.env` file before deployment
2. **Regular Security Audits**: Run `npm audit` regularly to check for new vulnerabilities
3. **Environment Management**: Use different `.env` files for different environments
4. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication system for production use

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `.env` - Environment variables (excluded from git)
- `.env.example` - Example environment file
- `.gitignore` - Enhanced git ignore rules
- `SECURITY_FIXES.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:
- `src/components/OwnerLogin.jsx` - Environment variable integration
- `src/components/AdminLogin.jsx` - Environment variable integration  
- `src/components/About.jsx` - Code injection fix
- `package.json` - Security overrides and version fixes

## Testing

After applying these fixes:
1. The application should start without webpack-dev-server errors
2. Login functionality should work with environment variables
3. All animations and interactions should function normally
4. No security vulnerabilities should remain in the critical/high categories

## Next Steps

1. Test the application thoroughly
2. Update credentials in `.env` file
3. Deploy with proper environment variable management
4. Consider implementing additional security measures for production
